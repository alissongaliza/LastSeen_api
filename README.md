# Simple API for checking movies and series availability information

### :warning: Before you use it

This project is just one way of learning something new. With that said, keep in mind I might introduce breaking changes in the near future. The purpose is not to provide the best (or even a decent) API for movie applications to connect to, but actually to test something new (workflow or techonology).

### :construction: What to expect

I intend to change things a little and learn maybe Redis or some specific AWS services, so refer to [version 1](https://github.com/alissongaliza/LastSeen_api/releases/tag/v1.0) if you want to see my barebone implementation of this lib.
